flaskeleton
===========

A skeleton flask app that's ready to work with third-party APIs. Woohoo!

Getting Started
---------------
Before you start writing any code, you will need to set up a virtual environment to isolate all of your app's requirements.

We use the `virtualenv` package to create our virtual environments. To install it, run
`pip install virtualenv`

Why use a virtualenv? It lets you install different versions of the same python package for different apps. It also prevents your team from running into the 'Well, it works on my machine!' problem. For more information, hit up (the virtualenv docs)[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv].
